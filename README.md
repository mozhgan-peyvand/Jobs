Optional features:
* Pagination:Â In the PopularMoviesFragment, the list is displayed to the user by pagination. But the Paging 3 library has not been used to implement this feature! Why? Because Paging 3 is very complicated and weird! For example, if you want to filter the data or change the color of one row of the list for any reason, you will face a severe challenge. For this reason, I have used a straightforward and, at the same time, flexible and testable solution that you can see.
* Night/Day mode:Â there is a button in the toolbar to change the theme to night and day mode.
